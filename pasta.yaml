interject: 'I''d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring
      to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it,
      GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another
      free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs,
      shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined
      by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every
      day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of
      GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users
      are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
      There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part
      of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that
      allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel
      is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only
      function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used
      in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically
      GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions
      are really distributions of GNU/Linux.'

      Mauro, SHUT THE FUCK UP!

      It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a
      maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel
      maintenance?

      If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the
      kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to
      understand?

      To make matters worse, commit f0ed2ce840b3 is clearly total and utter
      CRAP even if it didn't break applications. ENOENT is not a valid error
      return from an ioctl. Never has been, never will be. ENOENT means "No
      such file and directory", and is for path operations. ioctl's are done
      on files that have already been opened, there's no way in hell that
      ENOENT would ever be valid.

      Shut up, Mauro. And I don't _ever_ want to hear that kind of obvious
      garbage and idiocy from a kernel maintainer again. Seriously.

      I'd wait for Rafael's patch to go through you, but I have another
      error report in my mailbox of all KDE media applications being broken
      by v3.8-rc1, and I bet it's the same kernel bug. And you've shown
      yourself to not be competent in this issue, so I'll apply it directly
      and immediately myself.

      WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE!

      Seriously. How hard is this rule to understand? We particularly don't
      break user space with TOTAL CRAP. I'm angry, because your whole email
      was so _horribly_ wrong, and the patch that broke things was so
      obviously crap. The whole patch is incredibly broken shit. It adds an
      insane error code (ENOENT), and then because it's so insane, it adds a
      few places to fix it up ("ret == -ENOENT ? -EINVAL : ret").

      The fact that you then try to make *excuses* for breaking user space,
      and blaming some external program that *used* to work, is just
      shameful. It's not how we work.

      Fix your f*cking "compliance tool", because it is obviously broken.
      And fix your approach to kernel programming.

systemd: |-
      First off, systemd is not an init system, it has an init system as part of the systemd suite. systemd is a project to build a standardised lowlevel userland for Linux. The project is pretty comprehensive and it delivers a lot of functionality under one umbrella. It does away with a lot of older, often undermaintained software packages, which were traditionally used to assemble a low level userland.

      Which is where the contention comes from, as a system suite systemd is restrictive for Unix virtuosi who are used to tailor a system with wit, ingenuity, a lick and a prayer and a couple dozen of unrelated packages. systemd makes such knowledge useless.

      The faction that thinks that systemd is Linux's Hiroshima, finds all the added functionality bloat, unnecessary and dangerous, as it is all under development in one project.

      All the systemd jokes stem from the comprehensiveness as a low level system suite. People against it love to joke that one day systemd will write its own kernel.

      There is a lot of FUD and hate going around. Some arguments do have merit, a lot of eggs in one basket is certainly true, but as with all things in life, it depends which tradeoff you prefer. Do you want a suite of well designed software, working closely together, so that system management is streamlined or do you want the complete freedom to tailor your own low level system with a lot of time tested, interchangeable components.

      I have no desire to be a low level system designer, so I prefer systemd. I don't hate traditional init systems though. If a Linux system has one and I need to work with it, I'm still happy it boots and starts the necessary services.

fossdating: As a twenty year old single male I think it's very hard to find a
      girl who's actually interested in free software. I've had girls jokingly ask
      to "Netflix and chill" but when I tell her that I don't use Netflix since Netflix
      requires proprietary software to stream content, they stop talking to me. And
      worse if they do stay they think I'm weird since I blocked google IP's in my
      host file and we can't even watch youtube. I can't ever seem to get girls to
      come over to my place and I can't text them either. Once I get their numbers
      since I've added customs roms to my phone and refuse to use sms since it's a
      security concern I require all of my friends to download a free and open source
      messaging app and I share with them my public gpg key so that we can verify
      that our conversations are secure. None of my friends are willing to do this.
      And I can't use sites like tinder since it's not only proprietary software but
      a major privacy vulnerability. How come it is so hard to find a girl concerned
      about software freedom. I feel like I'm going to be a virgin forever.
paytoilets: Pay toilets are nasty, and ought to be illegal. Those of us who are
      not poor can afford the price, if we accept the practice; poor people can't.
      To deny people access to a toilet when they need one is nasty and degrading.
      I have concluded that the least we can do, to eliminate pay toilets, is to avoid
      giving them money. Instead of paying them, I go to great lengths to find some
      other toilet. Please join me in rejecting pay toilets firmly.

lecture: |-
  A lamer Ubuntu-using script kiddie corporate shill professor was teaching a class on Mark Shuttleworth, known corporate spy and Linux ’programmer’.

  ”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Shuttleworth and accept that he was the most highly-evolved programmer the world has ever known, even greater than Richard Stallman!”

  At this moment, a brave, i3-using, bash scripting Poweruser who had over 1500 vertically-segmented Terminator windows and understood the necessity of systemd and fully supported all design decisions made by the Arch developers stood up and held up his sister’s netbook.

  ”What’s this computer doing, pinhead?”

  The arrogant professor smirked quite graphically and smugly replied “It’s clearly using apt-get to update Ubuntu with all the latest software.”

  ”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since these packages were released. If it was actually installing the latest and best software, as you say… then it should be running Arch by now.”

  The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his Ubuntu phone and list of Amazon referral links. He stormed out of the room crying those shill corporate bloatware tears. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, Robbie Williamson, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a GNOME Unity user. He wished so much that he had a some privacy to shield himself from embarrassment, but he himself had sent his search history to Canonical’s servers!

  The students applauded and all installed Arch that day and accepted Aaron Griffin as their lord and savior. An eagle named “linux-ck” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalkboard. The ArchWiki was read several times, and Judd Vinet himself showed up and enacted a rolling release system across the country.

  The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. His system experienced kernel panic and he was forced to reinstall Windows for all eternity.
